Adding this project to Conda

This guide shows how to create a reproducible Conda environment for the project and verify it with a small smoke test.

Files added

- `environment.yml` - conda environment spec (uses `python=3.12` and common data libs).
- `smoke_test.py` - quick script that verifies Python and `pandas`, and prints first 3 rows of common CSVs.

Quick steps

1. Create the environment from `environment.yml`:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This creates an environment named `covid-sql-project` (change the `name:` in `environment.yml` if you prefer).

2. Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate covid-sql-project
```

3. (Optional) If you have a `requirements.txt` or want exact pip packages from your existing virtualenv, export and install them:

- From your existing virtualenv: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- Add `- -r requirements.txt` under the `pip:` section of `environment.yml` (or just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` after activating the env).

4. Verify with the smoke test:

```bash
python smoke_test.py
```

What if you use Postgres locally?

- `psycopg2` is included in the `environment.yml`. If you use `psycopg2-binary` instead, edit the pip section or replace `psycopg2` with `psycopg2-binary` in `environment.yml`.

Notes and next steps

- If you need R support for the `r_scripts/` folder, add `r-base` and `r-essentials` to the `environment.yml` dependencies (commented lines show this).
- For reproducible builds across machines, create a lockfile or export the explicit spec after creating the environment:

```bash
conda activate covid-sql-project
conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt
```

- If you want me to add a `requirements.txt` exported from the repo's existing venv (`datasets_env`) I can extract and add it to the repo.

Edge cases covered

- Missing CSV files: `smoke_test.py` warns for missing files but doesn't fail.
- psycopg2 build issues: prefer `psycopg2-binary` if you don't want to compile from source.
- Python mismatch: `environment.yml` pins `python=3.12` to match your included venv; change it if needed.

If you'd like, I can now:

- Export `pip` packages from the included `datasets_env` virtualenv into `requirements.txt` and add it to the repo, or
- Replace `psycopg2` with `psycopg2-binary`, or
- Pin exact package versions by inspecting `datasets_env`'s installed packages.

Tell me which of those you'd like and I'll proceed.
